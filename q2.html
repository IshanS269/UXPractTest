        <h1>Key Differences between writing in HTMl vs Google Docs</h1>

        <h3>Writing Aspect</h3>
        <p>In HTML, you have to write things individually for example you have to type h1 to get a level 1 heading compared to in google docs where you can highlight then just change the heading. Main differences are that you can type and fix whatever you want without coding it compared to HTML where you have to type it out, then end up adding more code to fix the colour of the font, resize the font, change the alignment of the text, etc.</p>
        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>In order to collaborate on google docs, you need to click share and type in the email you are trying to share to. When it comes to HTML, you need to take the code that you have done, push it to github, share the repository with others, let them pull the code and they can change the code. The key differences are: you cannot simultaneously change the code at the same time, the steps are very time consuming for sharing on html compared to just sharing a google doc.</p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>The usage for google docs is to create documents for writing. HTML is used for creating websites allowing you to have menus and links to other pages just like a normal website would have.</p>
